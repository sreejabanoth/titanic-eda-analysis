Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset using Python, Panda

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship Task . I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to identify trends, patterns, and relationships.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis
- Survival rate comparison by **Gender**, **Passenger Class**, and **Fare**
- Missing value identification
- Correlation heatmap
- Distribution plots

## Files Included
- `train.csv` - dataset used
- `Titanic_EDA_Notebook.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with code and visualizations
- `.png` files - saved plots used for reporting
- `Report On Exploratory Data Analysis` - report with key findings

## Summary
- Survival rate is approx 38%
- Females and 1st Class passengers had better survival chances
- Key features influencing survival: `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Fare`, `Age`
